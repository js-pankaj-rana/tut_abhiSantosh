=>JavaScript is the programming language for html and web.

=>External Scripts are practical when the same code is used for many different languages:

=> <script src="myScript.js"></script>

=> Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.

=> Writing into the HTML output using document.write();

=> Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().

=> Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

=>To access an HTML element, javascript can use the document.getElementById() method.

=>The id/class attribute define the HTML element. The innerHTML property define the HTML content.

=>The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and Variable values.

=>Fixed values are called literals where as Variable values are called variables.

=>Hypens are not allowed in javascript. It is reserved for substraction.

=>Old javascript examples may use a type attribute: <script type="text/javascript">
	The type attribute is not required now a days. JavaScript is default scripting language in HTML.

=>A JavaScript function is the block of JavaScript code that can be executed when called for. A function can be called when an events occurs, like an user click the mouse button or keyboard stroke.

=>Scripts can be placed in the <body> or in the <head> section of an HTML element or both.

=>JavaScript Display Possibilities: JavaScript can display data in different ways:

====>Writing into HTML element, using innerHTML.

====>Writing into HTML output, using document.write().

===>Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().

===>Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

=>JavaScript statement are composed of :
Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

=>Semicolons seperate javascript statements. (Ending statement with semicolons is not required, but highly recommended).

=>JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space in your script to make it more readable.

=>JavaScript statement can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets.

=>Strings are text, written within single or double quotes.

=>An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators which computes to a value.

=>In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variable (and keyword, and function, and labels).

=>All JavaScript identifers are case sensitive. JavaScript does not interpret VAR or var as the keyword var.

=>Hyphens are not allowed in javascript. It is reserved for subtractions.

=>All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.

=>When adding a string and a number, javascript will treat the number as a string.

=>JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequence can produce different result.

=>JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable is used for different data types.

=>String are written with quotes. You can use single quotes as well as double quotes. 

	=>>We can also use single quotes inside double quotes.
	=>>We can also use double quotes inside single quotes.

=>Boolean can only have values true and false. Booleans are often used in conditional testing.

=>JavaScript array are written with square brackets. Array item's are seperated by commas. Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], Second is [1], and so on.

=>Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and string will return a always string.
